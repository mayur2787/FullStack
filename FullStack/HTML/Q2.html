            <p>For instance, in some styles of writing, particularly journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one
                sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main idea.
                In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling idea,” because it controls what happens in
                the rest of the paragraph.</p>
