        <h3>What this handout is about</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">This handout will help you understand how paragraphs are formed, how to
            develop stronger paragraphs, and how
            to
            completely and clearly express your ideas</p>
        <h3>What is a paragraph?</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define
            paragraphs in terms of length: a paragraph
            is
            a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph is half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity
            and
            coherence of ideas among sentences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group
            of
            sentences or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance do
            not
            determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles of writing,
            particularly
            journalistic styles, a paragraph can be just one sentence long. Ultimately, a paragraph is a sentence or
            group
            of sentences that support one main idea. In this handout, we will refer to this as the “controlling
            idea,”
            because it controls what happens in the rest of the paragraph.</p>
        <h3>How do I organize a paragraph?</h3>
        <p style="text-align: justify;">There are many different ways to organize a paragraph. The organization you
            choose will depend on the
            controlling
            idea of the paragraph. <b>Below are a few possibilities for organization, with links to brief
                examples:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Narration:</b> Tell a story. Go chronologically, from start to finish. (See an example.)</li>
            <li><b>Description:</b> Provide specific details about what something looks, smells, tastes, sounds, or
                feels
                like. Organize spatially, in order of appearance, or by topic. (See an example.)</li>
            <li><b>Process:</b> Explain how something works, step by step. Perhaps follow a sequence—first, second,
                third.
                (See an example.)</li>
            <li><b>Classification:</b> Separate into groups or explain the various parts of a topic. (See an
                example.)
            </li>
            <li><b>Illustration:</b> Give examples and explain how those examples support your point. (See an
                example in
                the
                5-step process below.)</li>
        </ul>
